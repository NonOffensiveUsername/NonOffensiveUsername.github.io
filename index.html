      <p>After weeks at sea, land pierces the horizon. A mysterious continent
        awaits you, and with it the promise of wealth, power, and freedom
        unimaginable. Will you tame this frontier, or die like a dog? Only
        one thing is certain: Crullach has no sympathy.
      </p>



      <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
      <p>Crullach (pronounced like "crew-lock" or "craw-latch") is a newly
        discovered island. As a player, you take control of an ambitious
        individual with designs on it. In typical <em>Armada</em> fashion,
        the mechanics are designed to faciliate competition in the military
        and economic dimensions while allowing for broad freedom in choosing
        one's objectives.
      </p>

      <hr>

      <h2>Mechanics</h2>
      <p>The two primary systems of Crullach are those governing characters
        and settlements. Characters are individual people while settlements
        are populated places. You interact with the game world through a
        player character and their associated characters and settlements;
        collectively, these form your faction.
      </p>
      <h3 id="characters">Characters</h3>
      <p>Rather than tracking detailed statistics, characters in Crullach
        only require a level and, if their level is above zero, a class.
        Here's an example character sheet:
      </p>
      <div class="border p-1 mx-2 mb-3">
        <code>
            Millian Krain - Level 2 Mercenary
          </code>
      </div>
      <p>More rarely, a character could have multiple classes, each with
        their own level:
      </p>
      <div class="border p-1 mx-2 mb-3">
        <code>
            Godus Lanshaw - Lvl 3 Hunter / Lvl 1 Merchant
          </code>
      </div>
      <p>Finally, characters can have statuses. These are simple descriptors
        that explain how the character is different from others of their
        class. These can be inborn traits or temporary conditions. They can
        be chosen at the start of the game or assigned by the game master as
        needed. Statuses can also be removed by the game master. Examples of
        statuses are words like "wounded", "brave", "ugly" or "eagle-eyed".
      </p>
      <h3>Settlements</h3>
      <p>Controlling a character is only half of the game. In pursuing your
        you will doubtlessly wish to found and improve settlements. These
        will provide you with money, resources and manpower, as well as being
        the infrastructure you'll need to accomplish your goals. Settlements
        are represented almost exactly like characters; they have a class (or
        classes) and levels in these classes. But where a character might be
        a pikeman or a silversmith, a settlement is a village, or a trading
        post, or a fort. Also like characters, settlements can have statuses.
        Settlements are created through <a href="#projects">projects</a>.
      </p>
      <h3>Creating a Faction</h3>
      <p>When designing your faction, the first step is to have a concept.
        Your character should have a reason to be exploring Crullach. They
        might be after money, or fame, or independence for a religious or
        ethnic group.
      </p>
      <p>As a baseline, your player character is level one and has a class of
        your choice. Classes should be specific and represent concrete
        skills. Specificity and effectiveness are inversely correlated; a
        "fighter" might be comfortable with any weapon or armor but will be
        at a disadvantage in a duel against a "pikeman" using his weapon of
        choice, assuming the levels are the same.
      </p>
      <p>In addition to your character and their class, you have 18 pips to
        spend on improving your situation. Optionally, you may gain 2 more
        pips by adding a negative status to your character. This status should
        be strictly harmful and not easily mitigated.
      </p>
      <p>Pips can be spent on the following options. Each option can be taken
        as many times as you like and can afford.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>10 level 0 peasants. They believe in your cause and are ready to
          endure hardship for you.
        </li>
        <li>A level 1 specialist. Choose their class. Their relationship with
          you is yours to decide; they could be a relative, business partner,
          friend, slave, etc.
        </li>
        <li>3 level 0 specialists. As above, but less skilled.</li>
        <li>Increase the level of your player character or one of your
          specialists. The number of pips required is equivalent to their new
          level. For example, advancing a level one character to level 2 costs
          2 pips. This is cumulative; taking a level 1 character to level 3
          costs 2 + 3 = 5 pips.
        </li>
        <li>Add a useful status to one of your characters.</li>
        <li>100 gold groens. See <a href=#economics>economics</a> below for
          what this means and what you can spend them on.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="economics">Economics</h3>
      <p>The common currency of the empire is the silver drang, a small coin,
        a bit smaller and thicker than a dime, sufficient for a day's expenses
        in any city. 20 drangs is worth one golden groen, a month's wages for
        an unskilled laborer. More valuable coinage exists but is rarely seen,
        including the platinum vech (120 groens) which requires the expertise
        of a mage to mint.
      </p>
      <h4>Prices:</h4>
      <p>Prices are in groens. An * means that a price is variable; see the
        notes below the table.

        Specialists</a> in the gameplay section for an explanation of tool quality.

        spirits up.
      </p>
      <h3>Gameplay</h3>
      <p>Roleplay in Crullach is fluid and the passage of time will vary based on
        in game events. Resource management is done on a monthly basis. Each month
        you will allocate your available labor and resources towards various
        projects and handle events. Expect months to tick over every other day
        at 5pm.
      </p>
      <p>Turns can vary greatly based on what is happening in the game world.
        However, you will almost always do the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Update your stockpiles of food and money</li>
        <li>Divide your available labor among ongoing projects</li>
        <li>Handle events</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Make sure to properly organize your characters, settlements, and
        stockpiles for easy access and updating. Use your faction channel.
        It is extremely important to know what you have and where it is. Also
        be aware of your primary character's location, as news sometimes takes
        time to travel.
      </p>
      <h4 id="projects">Projects</h4>
      <p>The core action of settlement management in Crisis on Crullach is
        assigning projects. A project is a defined task which requires a
        certain amount of labor and resoruces to complete. This definition is
        purposefully open ended. Here are some examples of projects:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Building a bridge</li>
        <li>Mapping a hex</li>
        <li>Planting or harvesting the year's crop</li>
        <li>Choosing the best site for a new mine</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Be creative! Your very survival may depend on it. As game master, my
        goal is to promote and reward clever solutions; use your resources well,
        and your reliance on lucky rolls should be minimal.
      </p>
      <p>The biggest limitation to completing projects is labor. Labor is
        measured in manhours, a slightly abstracted representation of work
        done. A healthy human adult working at a sustainable pace can provide
        you with 250 manhours each month. In a pinch, you can push your people
        further, but beware the inevitable harm to morale and bodily health
        alike. Track your available monthly manhours, as this is your biggest
        resource. Each month, you will be informed about any changes in your
        available labor. Gaining or losing workers will affect the labor pool,
        but other factors can modify it as well. Harsh weather, disease, or
        malnutrition might reduce the efficiency of your workers, for example.
      </p>
      <p>To be productive, laborers need the right tools, materials, and
        guidance. Tools may be possible to improvise, but this will lower
        efficiency. Gathering or moving materials may also add time to a
        project. Complicated projects will need to be overseen by a specialist.
      </p>
      <h4>Buildings</h4>
      <p>You can acquire buildings by completing projects. Buildings are like
        class levels for your settlements, allowing them to help you achieve
        your goals. Generally, a project to construct a building takes about
        5,000 manhours per intended level of the building, plus one. Once you
        have one or more buildings on a hex, that hex becomes one of your
        settlements. Keep track of your settlements and the buildings they
        contain.
      </p>
      <p>Like character classes, building types are not restricted to a premade
        list, but have a name to describe their purpose. Here are some possible
        buildings:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Farm Estate</li>
        <li>Watch Tower</li>
        <li>Trading Post</li>
        <li>Fortification</li>
        <li>Mine</li>
        <li>Forge</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Buildings may need upkeep over time to combat decay and accidents.
        Expect to spend more maintaining costlier buildings.
      </p>
      <p><b>If you make sketches of your building and settlement layouts,
        they'll be slightly cheaper to construct.</b> Having visuals will make
        exploration more interesting and immersive for everyone!
      </p>
      <h4 id="specialists">Specialists</h4>
      <p>Knowledge can be more valuable than any tool. Only those with the correct
        skills can exploit the wealth of Crullach. A specialist is a character
        with a class focused on some non-combat field like construction, farming,
        or prospecting. They can be purchased with pips as part of faction building
        or hired later. Because of the great variety of possible specialists, there
        are no rules for individual types. Instead, they are all governed by
        general rules with the details determined on a case by case basis.
      </p>
      <p>The main functions of specialists are to advise you and oversee
        projects. As advisors, they are a valuable source of information. The
        mechanics behind important aspects of settlement building such as
        agriculture are purposefully opaque; consider specialists and their
        advice to be your way of peaking behind the veil and getting hints on
        the best course of action. For example, if you wish to farm, you will
        want an agricultural specialist to advise you on what crops would grow
        best on your land.
      </p>
      <p>Specialists can always advise you, but to actually perform their trade
        they require tools. The quality of tools available to the specialist
        limit how well they can do their job. In gameplay terms, the quality
        of the specialist's tools caps their effective character level. A level
        4 agriculturalist with tools of quality 2 will make rolls as if he is
        only second level. Depending on their task and specialty, they may
        require upkeep as well. The cost of upkeep, when applicable, is one
        fifth the cost of tools, per month. This is in addition to the costs of
        any raw materials the specialist is processing.
      </p>

      <h4>Agents</h4>
      <p>Your primary character can only be in one place at a time. To solve
        this problem, you can assign your underlings as agents and send them
        off to perform various tasks. Unlike projects, you won't know the
        status of the agent or his task until he returns to you, or not at all
        if the worst happens. You must properly supply your agent and give them
        carefully worded instructions, because once they've left, you cannot
        change them.
      </p>

      <p>Some tasks are especiallly suitable for agents:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Trade. Unless your character is a merchant and personally goes
          about handling the faction's finances, an agent will be needed to
          import or export. A skilled negotiator could be invaluable for
          getting good deals for your faction.
        </li>
        <li>Recruitment. An agent can be sent back to Exeter in order to seek
          out candidates and bring them back to Crullach. You must describe the
          type of people you want, and your agent will do their best to select
          and attract recruits. The amount of time taken and the likelihood of
          success depends on the rarity of fitting candidates (peasants are
          plentiful, master glassblowers are not), the relevant level of the
          agent, and how good a deal you're offering. "Be my servant" may
          attract the desparate or guillible, but the most useful people want
          their value to be recognized and rewarded.
        </li>
        <li>Exploration. Being gone for extended periods in the wild is a good
          way to come back to a devastated settlement.
        </li>
        <li>Diplomacy. There are no telephones on Crullach; aside from official
          visits, communication between distant settlements must happen through
          representatives. Make sure to pick someone you trust, and that they
          know what they're allowed to promise.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Advancement</h4>
      <p>Over time, characters can become more skilled. This will happen semi-
        randomly. Major accomplishments are especially likely to result in
        character advancement. Characters growing in ability may not be
        immediately beneficial. Specialists will usually need better tools to
        make use of a higher level. A disloyal character gaining levels may
        inspire them to plot against you!
      </p>

      <p>Primary characters will level faster than others. When your primary
        character levels up, you may choose to advance one of their current
        classes or give them a new class at level 1.
      </p>

      <p>This system is purposefully limited. The real way to become more
        powerful in Crullach is through building up your settlements, gaining
        wealth and growing your population. There are always opportunities!

      <h4>Action Resolution</h4>

      <p>Occasionally, to facilitate drama, an action will require a roll of
        the dice. In such situations, the GM will state a difficulty and ask
        for a roll. If the character performing the action has a class relevant
        to it, a d6 is rolled and the level added to the result. Otherwise, a
        d4 is rolled. If the action is higher than the difficulty, the action
        has the intended result. If the result is equal to the difficulty, the
        GM may or may not impose a complication. Otherwise, the action does not
        have the intended result.

        <code>Success probabilities for certain levels and difficulties.</code>
      </figure>

      <p>At the GM's discretion, characters can use their class as a similar
        class of a lower level. For example, a level 3 mercenary attempting to
        train soldiers could perform the task as a level 1 commander.
      </p>

      <p>Some actions are directly opposed by another person. In such cases,
        both characters roll in the usual way. But in addition to beating the
        difficulty, their result must be higher than their opponents. Both
        sides of a contest failing to equal or exceed the difficulty results
        in a fumble and a continuation of the contest after a short time,
        possibly allowing others nearby to intervene.
      </p>

      <p>When a roll is made in a dramatic situation, the GM will not reveal
        the difficulty number. After a roll but before the GM reveals the
        outcome, the player has the option of pushing it, giving them the
        opportunity to reroll. However, if the reroll is a failure, the
        situation will escalate; the consequences for failure will be more dire
        and the failing character will gain a negative status. The GM is the
        final arbiter of what counts as a dramatic situation.
      </p>

      <h3>Warfare</h3>
      <p>An army is an expensive undertaking. In a pinch, any able-bodied men
        can be mustered to fight, but they’ll perform relatively poorly and
        would be hopeless in an extended offensive operation. A competent
        fighting force that can project power must be actively maintained.
      </p>

      <h4>Raising Forces</h4>
      <p>Creating an army requires manpower, equipment, leadership, and time.
        Competent soldiers are classed characters; peons can only form
        militias. Turning ten peons into level 0 fighting men requires one
        month and a difficulty 4 roll from a trainer. Equipment must be
        purchased or made.
      </p>

      <p>Soldiers can perform other tasks but must spend at least half of their
        time on active duty or exercises to remain ready. Failing this
        requirement disbands the force; reassembling it requires retraining and
        paying to repair unmaintained equipment proportional to the period of
        neglect.
      </p>

      <h4>Force Representation</h4>
      <p>Each soldier has combat pips based on their type, representing their
        basic combat capabilities. Pips come in 4 types:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Shock, representing the basic effectiveness of the soldier in close combat</li>
        <li>Fire, for lethality at distances beyond a thrown weapon's reach</li>
        <li>Thrust, for long piercing weapons designed to fight cavalry</li>
        <li>Maneuver, for rapid response and flanking ability</li>
      </ul>

      <p>An army's total shock, fire, and thrust pips added together is its
        <em>strength</em>.
      </p>

      <p>Soldiers have a type representing how they are equipped and fight. The
        The pips are as described above; equipment cost is the type of
        soldier's kit and/or mount needed.

      <p>†: Contributes to the reconnaissance strength of the force.
      </p>

      <h5>Exceptional Soldiers</h5>
      <p>Soldiers with a level of 1 or more are superior among men and project
        superior force in battle. The soldier's pips are multiplied by their
        level minus 1, except for maneuver which is unaffected. Take care not
        to rely overmuch on such men, lest the bulk of your power be brought
        low by a single stray arrow. A man who achieves too much glory might
        also question your leadership. If you are nothing without him, why
        should he take orders from you?
      </p>

      <p>Exceptional equipment can further amplify the power of a mighty
        warrior. Equipment fine enough to multiply a soldier's effectiveness
        is not for sale at game start; the holders of such great power tend to
        guard it jealously. Such items are generaly unique and do not share
        mechanics.
      </p>

      <h4>Mass Combat</h4>
      <p>Except where specifically noted, rolls related to mass combat
        scenarios cannot be pushed.
      </p>

      <h5>Movement</h5>
      <p>Armies move depending on their type and stance. Foot soldiers move 10
        miles per day. Add another 10 miles for mounts, and another 10 if
        soldiers travel recklessly, strung out and without scouting. Speed is
        halved for bad weather and halved again for bad terrain. Armies moving
        through unknown lands are liable to become lost.
      </p>

      <h5>Starting a Battle</h5>
      <p>When two opposing armies enter the same hex, the commanders roll a
        contest. Both parties roll in secret and may push their roll if
        desired. The following modifiers effect the contest:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Higher recon strength than opponent: +1</li>
        <li>Noncombat stance: -2</li>
        <li>On familiar terrain (possessing maps and experience): +1</li>
      </ul>

      <p>In the case of a tie, both sides enter battle on equal footing.
        Otherwise, the winner has initiative equivalent to the margin by which
        he beats the loser. At this point a series of rounds are played until
        one or both forces retreat, surrender, or are destroyed.
      </p>

      <h5>Strategies and Modifiers</h5>
      <p>At the beginning of each round, the commanders of the two forces
        privately choose a strategy from the following list:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Attack. The default, with no special effects.</li>
        <li>Defend. Gain +1 (or +2 with fire superiority) but gain no
          initiative if the round is won.
        </li>
        <li>Charge. Gain +1 but take double casualties. Allows pushing rolls.
          If a pushed charge fails, take <em>quadruple</em> casualties!
        </li>
        <li>Feint. Suffer -1 but gain double initiative on a victory.</li>
        <li>Retreat. Disengage on a victory.</li>
        <li>Route. Disengage, guaranteed, but take double casualties.</li>
        <li>Parley. If the enemy commander accepts, there is a ceasefire and
          the two forces can negotiate. If the parley is rejected, the
          commander must change his strategy to defend, retreat, or route.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>After choosing strategies, the commanders roll a contest with several
        modifiers.
      </p>

      <h6>Strength Advantage</h6>
      <p>The more powerful force, as by strength value (shock + fire + thrust),
        gains a bonus commensurate with its degree of advantage, calculated as
        the ratio of the larger force's strength to the smaller.
      </p>

      <table class="table">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Strength Ratio</th>
            <th>Bonus</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>+0</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>1.5</td>
            <td>+1</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>+2</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>3</td>
            <td>+3</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>If the ratio falls in between two values, round down; 2.3 rounds to 2,
        1.6 rounds to 1.5, etc. The progression continues indefinitely.
        The commander of the larger force gets the bonus; the commander of the
        smaller force does not receive a corresponding penalty.
      </p>

      <h6>Initiative</h6>
      <p>In a battle, one side can have initiative, a number representing a
        variety of factors which give a situational advantage. Only one side
        can have initiative, or neither. The side with initiative adds the
        amount to their roll.
      </p>

      <h6>Superiority</h6>
      <p>A side with more of certain class of units gains superiority in that
        type. If a commander's army has 50% more fire pips than his opponent,
        he has fire superiority and gains +1. If he has double the fire pips or
        more, he gains +2. Maneuver superiority works similarly, with a catch.
        Before the ratio of maneuver pips is calculated, each side subtracts
        the other's thrust pips from their own maneuver pips.
      </p>

      <h6>Damage</h6>
      <p>As armies take casualties, they lose fighting effectiveness. Every
        full 10% of a force's effectiveness lost adds a -1 penalty to the rolls
        of its commander.
      </p>

      <h5>Playing the Round</h5>
      <p>With all modifiers tallied, the commanders roll a contest. This roll
        can be pushed if the charge strategy was chosen. Calculate the margin
        by which the winner of the contest beat the loser (0 if there was no
        winner). Both sides take casualties based on this margin, according to
        the following table:
      </p>

      </table>

      <p>These casualties represent soldiers that are killed, injured, fleeing,
        etc. In addition to both sides taking casualties, the winner gains
        initiative. If they already have initiative, increase it by one. If the
        enemy has initiative, decrease it by one. If neither side has it, the
        winner gains it.
      </p>

      <h5>Special Cases</h5>
      <p>Some combinations of strategies have specific effects:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>When both commanders choose to defend, the two forces merely
          skirmish. Halve casualties, rounding down to the nearest multiple of
          5%.</li>
        <li>If one side defends while the other retreats, the retreat
          automatically succeeds, and the retreating force takes half
          casualties.</li>
        <li>If one side defends while the other routes, the routing force does
          not take double casualties.</li>
        <li>If both sides choose retreat or route, they automatically succeed
          in disengaging and take no casualties.</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>Aftermath</h5>
      <p>If one side of the battle retreated or was destroyed, the other side
        takes the field. If both sides retreat, neither has the field. An army
        which has taken the field can regroup and recover their wounded,
        restoring half of the losses taken during the battle. If the losing
        army surrendered, the winner may allow them to do the same.
      </p>
      <p> Either army, regardless of whether they have the field, can have a
        dedicated medical character make a roll; they regain the result of the
        roll as a percentage of their strength, up to the amount of casualties
        taken.
      </p>
      <p>Non-recovered casualties are distributed among the forces by the GM,
        depending on the course of the battle. The army's pips are recalculated.
      </p>

      <h4>Sieges</h4>
      <p>Uhhhhhhh idk yet there shouldn't be any in the early game though.
      </p>

      <h4>Small Scale Combat</h4>
      <p>Smaller fights can be handled by the system, but may be stripped down
        in some cases, reduced to regular rolls or contests. I'm just going to
        feel it out and see how it goes.

      <h2 id="lore">Lore</h2>
      <p>Crullach takes place in a medieval low fantasy world. Your character
        is from Exeter, westernmost continent of the known world. Exeter is
        <em>de jure</em> under the rule of the Quadrattion, a government
        lead by a council of four god-kings known as Tetrarchs. In
        reality, Exeter is divided into functionally independent states bound
        together by complex webs of tribute and obligation, with the
        tetrarchs acting as an influential alliance.

      <h3>The Empire</h3>
      <p>Exeter. The Quadrattion. <em>The Empire</em>. Many names, but one
        truth. For the people of Exeter, the empire is completely synonymous
        with religion and the state at the conceptual level. True separatism
        is incredibly rare; most find the idea incomprehensible.
      </p>
      <p>The story of the empire's founding is the source of its spiritual
        and political authority. Before the arrival of the tetrarchs, the
        story goes, Exeter was a land of ignorance. The people lived in fear,
        terrorized by foul gods and their dark priests. Darkness reigned for
        an unknowable length of time, for mankind was so primitive that it
        lacked a calendar. But one day, the tetrachs descended from heaven
        on angelic horses. They rallied the people, forming a great army
        against the gods, and overthrew the priests. The tetrarchs declared
        the beginning of year zero, marking the beginning of the new imperial
        order.
      </p>
      <p>The government instituted by the tetarchs is an authoritarian
        theocracy, with themselves as the gods of its religion. According to
        church dogma, the current tetrarchs are one and the same with the
        founders of the empire. When a tetrarch's body begins to age, they go
        into seclusion for a time to be reborn in a new shape before emerging
        once more into public life. Insinuations that the tetrarch has
        perished and a new man taken his place is heresy. Heresy is treason.
        Treason is punishable by death.
      </p>
      <p>Each tetrarch governs a sacred city from which they project power across
        Exeter. The cities are arranged in a perfect square, forming a sacred
        sigil of protection across the entire continent. From north to south,
        the tetrarchs are Snovius, Karl the Kind, Djinasterin, and Loem. Each
        sacred city shares the name of its ruling tetrarch. The word of any
        tetrarch is law anywhere on Exeter, but they usually refrain from
        acting directly in matters far from their sacred city. Despite their
        physical distance from each other, the divine nature of the tetrarchs
        allows them to coordinate flawlessly in managing the empire.
